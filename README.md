Solving high dimensional HJB equation using tensor decomposition.

The most current version is [v1.0](https://github.com/ypleong/SeALS/tree/v1.0). The `master` branch is under development.

To use this tool, you need to install the [MATLAB Tensor Toolbox](http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/index-2.6.html)

The corresponding technical paper is [here](http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~yleong/docs/Research_Papers/SeALS.pdf), and the user guide is [here](http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~yleong/codes/SeALS_usersguide.pdf).

Disclaimer: This copy of the SeALS tool is not perfect. It is distributed for research purpose. So, it may contain bugs or other technical issues. The authors will try to help you with resolving those issues. However, there is no guarantee or whatnot on providing consistent technical support.
